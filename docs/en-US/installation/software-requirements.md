# Software Requirements

VVV requires recent versions of both Vagrant and VirtualBox to be installed.

[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) is a "tool for building and distributing development environments". It works with [virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization) software such as [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) to provide a virtual machine sandboxed from your local environment.

Provider support is included for VirtualBox, Parallels, Hyper-V, VMWare Fusion, and VMWare Workstation.
